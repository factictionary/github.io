<h1>About Factictionary</h1>
<p><em>Empowering curiosity through privacy-first tools and learning experiences.</em></p>

<h2>Our Vision</h2>
<p>Factictionary is an independent initiative created to make learning and creativity accessible to everyone. We provide a growing collection of free, browser-based tools and games designed to help students, creators, and professionals simplify tasks without compromising on privacy.</p>

<h2>What We Offer</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Utilities:</strong> Tools for working with PDFs, images, videos, and text — all running entirely in your browser.</li>
  <li><strong>Games:</strong> Fun and skill-enhancing games that improve focus, logic, and creativity.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Articles and resources that explain how technology can be used responsibly and effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Core Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> We never collect or upload your files. All operations are processed locally within your browser.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Factictionary is free to use, with no logins or downloads required.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We clearly explain how each feature works, so users always stay in control.</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We continuously experiment with new interactive and educational ideas that make learning engaging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Factictionary began as a simple experiment — combining everyday tools and brain-training games into a single, privacy-respecting platform. Over time, it evolved into a growing community space where users can learn, play, and explore without data tracking or intrusive ads.</p>

<h2>Future Roadmap</h2>
<p>We aim to expand Factictionary with learning tools, new collaborative experiences, and integrations that help students and creators achieve more — while keeping user data secure and private.</p>
